Open MATLAB\r\n2. Navigate to directory folder containing this README.txt\r\n3. Run `makeFigures`\r\n4. Wait\r\n\r\nNote: We could unfortunately not release the exact position of the\r\nCTBTO stations. As a consequence, figure 2C is omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Software files\r\n\r\n* matrixCleaning.m: \r\n  Reduce the transport matrix until a given condition number is obtained.\r\n\r\n* reconstructFromSyntheticData_Xe.m: \r\n  Simulate reconstruction error for synthetic data for different reconstruction\r\n  algorithm.\r\n\r\n* reconstructSourceL1Pos.m: \r\n  Reconstruct the emission source using L1 minimization with positivity\r\n  constraints.\r\n\r\n* opt_routines: \r\n  Directory containing all the optimization routines we use.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Data files\r\n\r\n* Data/matrixGFSXe.mat   : the transport matrix\r\n\r\n* Data/measXe.mat        : the measurement vector\r\n\r\n* Data/aPrioriSource.mat : the a priori source used in [1]\r\n\r\n\r\nErrata and caveats\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n* The scale of the y-axis of Figure 1. as published in the ICASSP proceedings\r\n  is wrong. The version of the paper in this repository contains the correct\r\n  figure. This code also produces the correct figure.\r\n\r\n* The exact lambda and epsilon parameters used to produce figure 1. were\r\n  unfortunately not recorded when creating the figure for the paper.\r\n  This code contains parameters producing an equally illustrative figure.\r\n\r\n* In figure 4. of the paper published in the ICASSP proceedings, the emissions\r\n  for 0m-50m and 300m-1000m were mistakenly shifted to the right by 5 ticks.\r\n  Their magnitude was however correct.\r\n  The version of the paper in this repository contains the correct figure. This\r\n  code also produces the correct figure.\r\n\r\n* The seeds of the random number generator experiments were unfortunately\r\n  not recorded when running the synthetic experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference\r\n---------\r\n\r\n[1] A.
