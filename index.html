        <h1>The Fukushima Inverse Problem</h1>
        <p>The Fukushima inverse problem. Code and data to compute emissions of radioactive material at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant during the Great Tohoku Earthquake of 3/11 2011. This code allows to reproduce results published at ICASSP 2013.</p>

M. Martinez-Camara, I. Dokmani\'{c}, J. Ranieri, R. Scheibler, M. Vetterli, and A. Stohl,
<strong>The Fukushima inverse problem</strong>, ICASSP 2013, Vancouver, 2013.</p>

<p>The original paper is available <a href="http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/182697/files/icassp.pdf?version=2">online</a>
and attacks the problem of estimating the magnitude and timing of radioactive release
at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant during the accident in March 2011.</p>

<a name="abstract" class="anchor" href="#abstract"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Abstract</h2>

<p>Knowing what amount of radioactive material was released from Fukushima in
March 2011 is crucial to understand the scope of the consequences. Moreover, it
could be used in forward simulations to obtain accurate maps of deposition. But
these data are often not publicly available, or are of questionable quality. We
propose to estimate the emission waveforms by solving an inverse problem.
Previous approaches rely on a detailed expert guess of how the releases
appeared, and they produce a solution strongly biased by this guess.  If we
plant a nonexistent peak in the guess, the solution also exhibits a nonexistent
peak. We propose a method based on sparse regularization that solves the
Fukushima inverse problem blindly. Together with the atmospheric dispersion
models and worldwide radioactivity measurements our method correctly
reconstructs the times of major events during the accident, and gives plausible
estimates of the released quantities of Xenon.</p>

<p>To recreate all four figures from the paper, follow these steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open MATLAB</li>
<li>Navigate to directory folder containing this README.txt</li>
<li>Run <code>makeFigures</code>
</li>
<li>Wait</li>
</ol><p>Note: We could unfortunately not release the exact position of the
CTBTO stations. As a consequence, figure 2C is omitted.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The scale of the y-axis of Figure 1. as published in the ICASSP proceedings
is wrong. The version of the paper in this repository contains the correct
figure. This code also produces the correct figure.</p></li>
<li><p>The exact lambda and epsilon parameters used to produce figure 1. were
unfortunately not recorded when creating the figure for the paper.
This code contains parameters producing an equally illustrative figure.</p></li>
<li><p>In figure 4. of the paper published in the ICASSP proceedings, the emissions
for 0m-50m and 300m-1000m were mistakenly shifted to the right by 5 ticks.
Their magnitude was however correct.
The version of the paper in this repository contains the correct figure. This
code also produces the correct figure.</p></li>
<li><p>The seeds of the random number generator experiments were unfortunately
not recorded when running the synthetic experiments.</p></li>
